<h3>What I´m currently working on:</h3>
I have recently completed the neue fische Bootcamp, where I focused on building projects with React, Next.js, and TypeScript. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in these areas and exploring additional technologies like Tailwind CSS for styling and setting up development environments using Dev Containers. My goal is to continually expand my skill set and stay up to date with modern web development trends. I am currently learning Angular to master another framework in the near future, and I am involved in a large Angular project.
